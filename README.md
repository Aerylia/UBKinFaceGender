# UB KinFace Gender Annotation
This repo contains the gender annotations for the UB KinFace V2 kinship verification dataset.
These [annotations](UBKinFaceGender.csv) were performed visually and may contain mistakes (all genders are assumed).

The _id_ column contains the respective filename, the _parent_ column contains the gender of the parent and the _child_ column contains the gender of the child. Genders are annotated with _m_ for male and _f_ for female.

The UB KinFace V2 dataset itself can be found [here](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/research/Kinface/Kinface.htm).
